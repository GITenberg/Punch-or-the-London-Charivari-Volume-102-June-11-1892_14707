    <h2>A DAY AT ANTWERP.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By the "Vacuus Viator."</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>In the Place Verte.</i>&mdash;"The traveller," according
    to <i>Bædeker</i>, "should at once direct his steps to the
    Cathedral." Not going to be bullied by <i>Bædeker</i>! Shall
    assert my independence by directing steps somewhere else first.
    Carillon tinkling fitfully up in tower. Like an elderly ghost
    with failing memory, trying to play every tune she ever knew
    all at once on a cracked, old spinnet. Fancy I detect fragment
    of "<i>The Heavens are Telling</i>," tripped up by the "<i>Old
    Hundredth</i>," and falling over "<i>Haydn's Surprise</i>."
    Ghost tries back, and just as she seems about to arrive at
    something definite&mdash;suddenly gives it up as hopeless. To
    Church of St. Paulus, to see the Calvary. Small but highly
    intelligent Belgian Boy, who speaks English, insists on
    volunteering services. (Why aren't <i>our</i> street-boys
    taught French and German in Board Schools?&mdash;make all the
    difference to foreigners in London.) Boy takes me up avenue of
    heroic-sized scriptural statues, introduces me to "Moïse,"
    "Dahvit mit de 'arp," and others. Kind of him&mdash;but I wish
    he would go. Offer him twopence. Boy declines with indignation.
    Young Belgium evidently high-minded and sensitive. He informs
    me that, in a certain church he refers to as "Sin Yack," there
    are "RUBENS' peecture&mdash;moch fine," and plainly proposes to
    conduct me thither. Mustn't hurt his feelings again&mdash;so
    accept. Boy clumps on ahead, down alleys, and through
    back-streets, and round corners, looking round severely at
    intervals to see that I am not giving him the slip. Nice
    friendly little fellow&mdash;but despotic. Don't seem to be
    much nearer; "Sin Yack" evidently a saint of retiring
    disposition.... At last. Boy points him out triumphantly. Thank
    him, with apologies for taking him so much out of his way. Boy
    demands two francs. Hint, as delicately as possible, that I
    consider this estimate of the value of his time and society
    somewhat high. Boy peremptory. Give him fifty centimes. Boy
    abusive; follows me with uncomplimentary remarks. I can
    <i>not</i> go about Antwerp all day with a hostile boy
    harassing my rear like this! So undignified. However, shall
    find sanctuary with "Sin Yack." Every door closed. Boy at a
    distance&mdash;chuckling, I am afraid. Shall walk on&mdash;not
    <i>hurrying</i>, but briskly. Boy gone at last&mdash;thank
    goodness!&mdash;with Parthian yelp of "Rosbif!"</p>

        <a href="images/277.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="'Rosbif!'" /></a>"Rosbif!"
    </div>

    <p><i>In the Cathedral.</i>&mdash;Being shown round by
    Sacristan, in company with two respectable young Britons. "You
    shee dot oltarbiece, gentlemens," says Sacristan, "paint by
    RUBENS, in seexteen day, for seexteen hondert florin."
    Whereupon both Britons make a kind of "cluck" with their
    tongues. "Dat vos von hondert florin efery day he vas paint,"
    explains the Sacristan. Britons do this division sum in their
    heads, check it as correct, and evidently feel increased
    respect for RUBENS as capable-for an artist&mdash;of driving a
    good bargain. "RUBENS baint him ven he vas seexteen," which
    younger Briton considers "very <i>creditable</i> to him, too!"
    They inspect the High Altar, with more clucks, and inform one
    another, with the air of Protestants who are above prejudice,
    that it's a marvellous piece o' <i>work</i>, though, mind yer!
    Sacristan points out holes underneath choir-stalls. "De organ
    is blay over dere, and de mooshique he com out hier troo de
    'oles, so all be beoples vas vender vere de schounds com from!"
    First Briton remarks to me that "That's a rum start, and no
    mistake." I agree that it <i>is</i> a rum start. I shall find
    myself clucking presently, I know! "Haf you scheen yed de
    bortraits of GLATSHTONE and Lort BAGONSFELDT?" Sacristan asks
    us "... 'No?' then I show you." He leads us up to the finial of
    one of the stalls, which is carved in the figure of a monk. "Is
    not dat de Ole Grandt Man himself?" he asks, triumphantly.
    Second Briton agrees "It's a wonderful likeness, reelly." His
    Companion admits "They've got old GLADSTONE there to a
    <i>t</i>"&mdash;but adds that "come to <i>that</i>, it might do
    for <i>either of</i> 'em." "Lort BAGONSFELDT" is opposite, but,
    as Sacristan observes, would be more like "if dey only vas gif
    him a leedle gurl on de vorehead." Next we are taken to the
    Retro-Choir and shown the "mosh gurious and peautiful bainting
    in de ole Cathedrale. Schtand yust hier, Gentelmens, <i>now</i>
    you see him. Beoples say, 'Oh, yais, <i>ve</i> know, yust a
    marble-garvings&mdash;a baw releff!' I dell you, nodings of de
    kindt. All so flat as a biece of vite baper&mdash;com close op.
    Vat you tink? Vonderful, hey?" Britons deeply impressed by this
    and other wonders, and inform Sacristan that their own
    Cathedrals "ain't <i>in</i> it." "Look at the <i>value</i> of
    the things they've <i>got</i> 'ere, you know," they say to me,
    clucking, and then depart, after asking Sacristan the nearest
    way to the Zoo.</p>

    <p><i>At Table d'hôte.</i>&mdash;Fellow-countrymen to the fore;
    both my immediate neighbours English, but neither shows any
    inclination to converse. Rather glad of it; afternoon of
    Museums and Galleries instructive&mdash;but exhausting. Usual
    Chatty Clergyman at end of table, talking Guide-book
    intelligently; wife next him, ruminating in silence and
    dismally contemplating artificial plant in a plated pot in
    front of her. It <i>is</i> a depressing object&mdash;but why
    look at it? Horror of two Sportsmen opposite on being offered
    snipe. "Snipe <i>now</i>&mdash;Great Scott!" they exclaim, "And
    ain't they <i>high</i> too?" One helps himself to some, with a
    sense that being on the Continent makes all the difference. But
    even <i>his</i> courage fails on being offered stewed apricots
    with it. Close by a couple of Americans; a dry middle-aged man,
    and a talkative young fellow who informs him he was at Harvard.
    Elder man listens to him with a grim and wooden forbearance.
    "Ez fur languages," the younger man is saying. "I'd undertake
    to learn any language inside of six months. Fur enstance, I got
    up Trigonometry in two. You'll tell me that <i>isn't</i> a
    language, and that's so, but take <i>Latin</i> now, I'd learn
    Latin&mdash;to write <i>and</i> speak&mdash;in a year, Italian
    I'd learn in a fortnight&mdash;with constant <i>study</i>, you
    understand. Then there's German. Well. I cann't <i>read</i>
    German&mdash;not in their German text, I cann't, and I don't
    <i>speak</i> it with fluency, but I can ask my <i>way</i> in
    it, and order anything <i>I</i> want, and I reckon that's about
    as much as a man requires to know of any language. Will you
    take a glass of wine outer my bottle? I've another coming
    along." Elder man declines stiffly, on plea that he is almost a
    teetotaller. "Well, maybe you're wise," says the Harvard man,
    "but I've discovered a thing that'll put you all right in the
    morning when you've eaten or drunk more'n's good for you
    overnight. I'll tell you what that thing <i>is</i>. It's just
    persly&mdash;plain ordinary simple persly. You eat a bunch o'
    fresh persly first thing you get up, and it don't matter
    <i>what</i> you've taken, you'll feel just as <i>bright</i>!"
    Elder man, who has been cutting up his chicken into very small
    pieces, looks up and says solemnly, "You may consider yourself
    vurry fortunate in being able to correct the errors you allude
    to by a means which is at once so efficacious and so innocent."
    After which he subsides into his salad. Harvard man shut
    up.</p>

    <p><i>In the Fumoir.</i>&mdash;Two drearily undecided men
    trying to make up their minds where to go next. Shall they stay
    at Antwerp for a day or two, or go over to Brussels, or go back
    to Calais and stay there, or <i>what</i>? "Calais is on their
    way <i>home</i>, anyhow," says one, and the other, without
    attempting to deny this, thinks "there may be more to
    <i>see</i> at Brussels." "Not more than there is here," says
    his friend: "all these places much about the same." "Well,"
    says the first, yawning, "shall we stay where we <i>are</i>?"
    "Just as <i>you</i> please," says the other. "No; but what
    would <i>you</i> rather do?" ... "Me? oh, I'm entirely in
    <i>your</i> hands!" First man, who has had Green Chartreuse
    with his coffee and seems snappish, annoyed at this, and says,
    "it's dam nonsense going on like that." "Oh," says the second,
    "then you leave it to <i>me</i>&mdash;is <i>that</i> it?"
    "Haven't I been saying so all along!" growls the other. Second
    Undecided Man silent for a time, evidently forcing himself to
    come to a decision of some sort. At last he looks up with
    relief. "<i>Well</i>," he says, very slowly, "what do
    <i>you</i> think about it?" Whereupon they begin all over
    again. This indecision is catching&mdash;leave them.</p>

    <p><i>In the Street&mdash;about</i> 11:30 P.M.&mdash;Back from
    Variety Theatre. Hotel doors closed. Have rung several
    times&mdash;no result at present. Curious impression that I
    shall be hauled up before a Dean or somebody for this to-morrow
    and fined or gated. Wish they'd let me in&mdash;chilly out
    here. <i>Is</i> there a night-porter? If not&mdash;awkward.
    Carillon again from Cathedral tower. Ghost has managed to
    recollect a whole tune at last, picking it out with one finger.
    Seem to have heard it before&mdash;what the Dickens <i>is</i>
    it? Recognise it as the "Mandolinata in E." Remember the VOKES
    Family dancing to it long ago in the Drury Lane Pantomime. Not
    exactly the tune one would expect to meet in a Cathedral....
    Unbolting behind doors. Nervous feeling. Half inclined to
    assure Porter penitently that this shall not occur again. Wish
    him good-night instead&mdash;pleasantly. Porter
    grunts&mdash;<i>un</i>pleasantly. Depressing to be grunted at
    the last thing at night. To bed, chastened.</p>

        you are absolutely cut out for Parliament&mdash;absolutely
        cut out for it!</p>

        <p><i>Jones</i> (<i>sadly</i>). I wish I could think so.
        But alas, no, after the Archbishop's letter, I must, I will
        give it up.</p>

        <p><i>Brown.</i> Have you not made the question of the
        Criminal Code your own?</p>

        <p><i>Jones.</i> Yes, but I must admit (and I make the
        admission with shame) that years ago at school I was
        rightly accused of stealing apples.</p>

        <p><i>Brown.</i> And was the accusation believed&mdash;were
        you punished?</p>

        <p><i>Jones</i> (<i>struggling with his emotion</i>). Alas!
        it was, and I received (from the Bench) a severe reprimand.
        It brings the red blood into my cheeks&mdash;a severe
        reprimand!</p>

        <p><i>Brown</i>. Then you know all about the Libel
        Acts,&mdash;you are up in a slander?</p>

        <p><i>Jones</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). And should I not be? Do
        you not know that I was once fined ten shillings and costs
        for saying that a drunken cook was intoxicated!</p>

        <p><i>Brown.</i> Surely there was not much harm in
        that?</p>

        <p><i>Jones.</i> It was immoral to call the cook
        intoxicated, and the Archbishop says, "that persons
        previously condemned on grounds of immorality of all kinds
        are not proper legislators." Under the circumstances I have
        detailed, I should not be a proper legislator!</p>

        <p><i>Brown.</i> But look at me! Here am I living a free
        life, doing exactly what I please, and deserving the
        censure of the Bench five times a week! I will undertake to
        say that you are three times as good a fellow as I am; yet
        I am as certain of my seat as possible.</p>

        <p><i>Jones</i> (<i>sadly</i>). But there is a gulf between
        us&mdash;the gulf that divides not-entirely-conscious
        innocence and half-imaginary vice. You are safe, and I am
        not.</p>

        <p><i>Brown.</i> I don't see why! Why am I safe? Or rather
        let me mend the question&mdash;why do you think your chance
        of being elected so small?</p>

        <p><i>Jones.</i> Because, my dear BROWN, I have been found
        out!</p>

    <i>Les deux frères</i> ("Brothers of Corse"), JEAN and EDOUARD,

    Laurent</i>. EDWARD looked the reverend, kind-hearted, but
    eccentric herbalist to the life, singing splendidly. But
    Brother JOHN, in black wig, black moustache, and with pallid
    face, look so unhealthy a <i>Romeo</i> that his appearance must
    have first excited <i>Juliet's</i> pity, which we all know is
    akin to love. My advice to JOHNNIE DE RESZKÉ is to "lighten the
    part," and "do it on his head,"&mdash;which, being summed up,
    means flaxen-haired wig and light moustache. <i>Juliette
    Eames</i> charming. <i>Nurse Bauermeister</i> too young.
    <i>Tybalt Montariol</i>, when killed, must not lie "toes up"
    too close to Curtain. Friendly members of Capulet faction
    rescued his legs, otherwise these members must have suffered.
    M. DUFRICHE, as <i>Mercutio</i>, mistaken for EDOUARD DE
    RESZKÉ. Subsequent appearance of the real Simon Pure as The
    Friar only complicates matters, but death of <i>Mercutio</i>
    settles it. The survivor is EDOUARD DE RESZKÉ. Mr. ALEC MARSH,

    <h2>THE WELSHERS AT THE MANSHUN HOUSE.</h2>

    <p>We've ad the Welshers ere, and did they injy theirselves?
    Didn't they jest! And wosn't they all jest perlite to us
    Waiters, as all true gents allus is, and didn't they amost
    shout theirselves hoarse when the LORD MARE got up to perpose
    the fust Toast! But not qwite, oh no, not by no means, or they
    woodn't have bin abel to sing what they calls their Nashnal
    Hanthem so bewtifoolly that they made the werry tears cum into
    my old eyes! One on 'em kindly told me as they calls it, "Him
    glad to find Ada," which means, "The Land of my Fathers"! and a
    werry nice name too, tho I don't quite see why they shoud leave
    out their pore Mothers, but it's the ushal way of the world,
    out of site out of mind! but they makes up for it by calling
    the Land of their Fathers, their Mother country, so it comes
    all rite in the end.</p>

    <p>The same kind Gent told me he oped they would sing their
    favrit song, "Ah, hide her nose!" commonly called "<i>Poor</i>
    MARY ANN!" so I should think indeed.</p>

    <p>I didn't see, in looking down the long list of Gests, no
    gent by the name of TAFFY, at which I was summut serprized.</p>

    <p>I heard a gent interdoosed as the Edditer of "the General
    Gimrig," which I takes to be a Raddicle Paper. I didn't at all
    no afore what a wunderfooll harrystokratic place little Wales
    is. Why we had about a duzen Nobbelmen inclewding a reel Dook,
    and as if that wosn't rayther a staggerer, we had no less than
    four reel Bishups with Harchdeecuns to match, about thirty
    Members of Parlement, and quite a brood of Welch Mares.</p>

    <p>I suttenly thort as I had had a werry fair sampel of Welch
    enthusyasm and Welch loyalty when I herd them jine in singin
    <i>our</i> Nashnal Anthem; but lor it was nothin to their
    recepshun of the LORD MARE when he guv 'em the Toast of the
    hevening, "Wales!" Why they sprung to their feet, Bishups, and
    Harchdeecuns, and Dook, and Nobbelmen, and M.P.'s and all, and
    shouted and cheerd and emtied their glasses, and then gave
    three such cheers as made the hold All ring again! Which I
    wished as the Prinse of WALES was there to heer 'em.</p>

    <p>BROWN and me had our nice quiet larf together at the ushal
    bit of fun. When sum werry ellerkent gent was a makin a speach
    as was rayther too long for them as wanted to heer the lovely
    Welch mewsic, they began for to hammer on the table with our
    bewtifool silver spoons and reel cut glasses, meaning to say,
    "That's about enuff," but the pore delewded Horrator thort it
    meant, "Keep it up, my boy; it's splendid!" So he kep it up
    till two of our best glasses was broke, and then he kindly sat
    down looking the werry pictur of happiness. It reminded me of a
    simlar little delushun as we practises early in the year.
    "Waiter," says sum hungry Gent, "bring me sum more Whitebait,"
    and I takes him sum more Sprats, and he is quite content! As
    our Grate Poet says, "Where hignorance makes you 'appy, remane
    as you are"! Upon the whole, I wentures to think as the Welch
    Nashnal Bankwet, given by Lord Mare EVANS, was about the most
    sucksessful as I have ewer assisted at during my menny years of
    such pleasant xperiences. I finishes by saying, I should werry
    much like to see a reel Irish Lord Mare try his hand in the
    same Nashnal way.</p>

    was the Waiter's answer. The Alderman said not a word; he
    smiled a sickly smile. There was no help for it, or "no helping
    of it," as he truthfully put it. He would do his best with the
    remainder of the <i>menu</i>. The resignation of the Alderman

    <p>The House of Lords Committee of Privileges decided that
    Captain FORESTER's action in the Barnard Peerage case was a
    Vane attempt. "The chance," said the <i>Times</i>, "of such a
    prize as Raby Castle, with £60,000 a-year, is likely to tempt a
    man to think his arguments and claims are better than they
    really are." Raby Castle on the brain would soon become a sort
    of Rabies.</p>

    <h2>THE CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>No. XI.&mdash;THE DUFFER IN LOVE.</h3>

    <p>Mrs. McDUFFER never greatly admired the lady with whom this
    confession is concerned. She denies that CECILIA BRAND was
    pretty, and when I do not answer (for where is the use of
    argument in such a case?), she remarks that I am too
    short-sighted to know whether a woman is pretty or not. This
    appears to myself to be an injudicious assertion, and the flank
    of my opponent might be turned if it were worth while. But it
    is not worth while. A Duffer I may be, but not such a duffer as
    to reason with a woman. If you score a point (and how many
    times one sees an opening in the fair one's harness), a woman
    is angry, or cries, or both, and there is no repartee to that
    <i>ultima ratio</i>.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/285.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/285.png"
             alt="'It was while thus engaged that I heard a sound of female voices.'" />
        </a>"It was while thus engaged that I heard a sound of
        female voices."
    </div>

    <p>I maintain, then, that CECILIA was pretty, and very pretty;
    pleasant, and very pleasant. No doubt she keeps those qualities
    yet. I do not believe in the syllogism by which a man persuades
    himself that he was a fool, that he had a lucky escape, that a
    girl becomes quite another person, and usually very stout and
    stupid, because she has preferred someone else to himself. No,
    if we met to-morrow&mdash;But Fortune forbid that we should
    meet to-morrow, or any other day! I have no relics of CECILIA.
    I had some,&mdash;an old glove, a lash of a riding-switch, and
    other trifles. I kept them in the secret drawer of a bureau,
    and in my absence that bureau was traded away for a new
    æsthetic article, relics and all, of course. Perhaps some minor
    poet bought the piece of furniture, and found the things, and
    wrote a poem on them. That is what makes me uncomfortable. If
    CECILIA sees the poem in one of the Magazines, and remembers
    the incidents which the souvenirs recall, she will certainly
    not be pleased with me, whether she fancies that I wrote the
    poem, or that I forgot all about the treasures, and traded
    their receptacle away. Life is really very complicated.</p>

    <p>I met CECILIA at a house in the country. We sat next each
    other at dinner. I found her charming. We had the same taste in
    novels,&mdash;she knew Miss AUSTEN almost off by heart, and,
    like me, she was very fond of field sports. I flattered myself
    that she did not find my company uncongenial. In the evening
    there was a little dance: I don't dance, or at least, it was
    some time since I had danced, not in fact since the used to
    make me take dancing lessons at school. How I hated it!
    However, this time I thought it seemed very easy and pleasant,
    though the floor was extremely polished and slippery,
    dangerously so. CECILIA, of course, was my partner. You know
    how they describe waltzing in novels, the ecstasy of it, the
    wild impassioned delight. Consult GUY LIVINGSTONE and OUIDA.
    Well, it was not at all like that.</p>

    <p>I do not exactly remember what occurred. We started, there
    was a buzz. I think there was a collision. I became extremely
    dizzy.... When I recovered my senses, it was <i>not</i> to find
    the dark grey eyes of CECILIA bending over me with an
    expression of anxiety. No, she was not there. I went to bed: I
    know there was a great contusion on my elbow.</p>

    <p>Next morning, it was winter, everyone was going to skate.
    Now I could not skate. At school, when there was a skating
    holiday, I always passed it beside the fire, which I had all to
    myself, roasting apples, and reading <i>Ivanhoe</i>. These were
    among my happiest hours. However, I did not tell CECILIA that I
    could not skate. I pretended (it seemed safe) to be desperately
    fond of hunting, and to despise skating. Besides I had work,
    literary work, I told CECILIA, an article on Miss AUSTEN. This
    pleased her, but nobody accepted the article. In fact, I was
    bent on secretly learning to skate. I sent to town for a pair
    of "Acmes," for I knew I never could manage all the straps and
    buckles of the ordinary modern skate. I knew of a pond where
    nobody came, and thither, under cover of night, I smuggled a
    bed-room chair. They say that pushing a chair in front of you
    is a good way to learn. My terror was extreme; it would be
    awkward to be caught, at a friend's house, stealing a bed-room
    chair. That I ventured this risk shows how fond of CECILIA I
    was. I reached the pond safely, and hid the chair in a dry
    ditch. Next day, when presumed to be engaged on literary
    labours, I sneaked back, sat down on my chair, and tried to put
    on the skates. It always seemed so easy when one saw an expert
    do it, like Mercury donning his winged shoon, and sailing over
    the ice. But my hands grew blue as I struggled with the key and
    the nuts, till I became certain that my boots were in
    fault.</p>

    <p>There was no help for it, I hid my chair in its ditch, and
    returned, to take the village cobbler into my confidence. He,
    good man, rose to the situation, and pointed out what I had
    surmised to be the case, viz., that the heels of my boots were
    too long to allow the chisel-edged flange to be adjusted by the
    lever, and admit at the same time of the other end of the heel
    being gripped by the cramps,&mdash;but he promised to whittle
    away part of the heel, and send the skates home without delay:
    and he was as good as his word.</p>

    <p>This time I took the precaution of fitting them on in my
    room. I walked about in them, and was happy. Next day I got to
    work again: gingerly I brought my chair into action, but I was
    wholly unprepared for the extreme slipperiness of the ice, even
    though forewarned to some extent by the painful experiences of
    <i>Mr. Winkle</i>. I had read that the skater "is very highly
    favoured when contending with the great enemy of motion, viz.,
    friction," a proposition which I found to be perfectly true. My
    legs developed separatist tendencies, and started on
    independent orbits. Often I found myself sitting down in a
    position affected by acrobats, but unusual in Society. As for
    the chair, it would rear and plunge like a horse, or escape
    across the ice, where I had to crawl to it on my knees. It was
    while thus engaged that I heard a sound of female voices, and,
    lo! there were CECILIA and two other girls, who had heard of
    this pond in the wood, and come to try it. I presented a
    singular spectacle, kneeling before a bed-room chair in the
    middle of a lonely pond. They laughed, a lover should never be
    ridiculous, but how could I help it! I thought it best to be
    frank, indeed, what excuse could I make, what explanation could
    I offer? In the evening I told CECILIA that I had undergone all
    this for her sake; that, expert in other pastimes (except
    dancing), I had hoped to make myself more worthy of "figuring"
    in her society. But, as a matter of fact, I never got so far as
    figures.</p>

    <p>Next day there was a thaw, and soon I had an opportunity of
    riding with CECILIA. It was "The Last Ride Together," as in Mr.
    BROWNING. I don't like to speak about it. When we got off the
    road on to the turf my horse began to kick and plunge. I have
    read that it is not right, but I did what I always do, I held
    on by the pummel. Would <i>you</i> not hold on by the carpet,
    in an earthquake. It felt like a young and lively earthquake.
    We came home soon, <i>CECILIA leading my horse</i>. People
    staying in the house met us.</p>

    <p>I did not propose to CECILIA. I thought, like <i>Sir Andrew
    Aguecheek</i>, "It is four to one she'll none of me." Nay, the
    odds were probably even longer. Ah, CECILIA, if these lines
    meet thine eyes, thou wilt know that one heart still is true.
    In another life, less begirt by material difficulties, we may
    meet amongst the asphodel, where there is no opportunity for
    the display of mere mechanical accomplishments. Till then,
    <i>au revoir</i>!</p>

    <p>APPROPRIATE.&mdash;At Nancy, the Maire pledged the Czech
    gymnasts, in a goblet of Pommery. Their chief, returning thanks
    in French, with a strong Bohemian accent, remarked that he took
    this as a great compliment to his own nationality, the
    champagne being "<i>très Czech</i>."</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Of my two selections to supply the
    last Horse in the Derby&mdash;one&mdash;<i>La Flêche</i>, so
    far forgot what was due to my prophetic utterances as to finish
    <i>second</i>&mdash;and indeed, very nearly <i>win</i>!
    However, as such reprehensible conduct was mainly owing to the
    absurd wish of her jockey, BARRETT, to be first, my readers
    will see that no blame attaches to <i>me</i>&mdash;as the mare
    would doubtless not have hurried so much had she been left to
    her own devices&mdash;(the sex notoriously dislikes
    hurry)&mdash;it being a well-known fact that she would make a
    race with a donkey!&mdash;though why donkey races should be
    spoken of with such contempt. I don't know, for I once rode one
    with Lord ARTHUR on Hampstead Heath&mdash;(it was during our
    engagement, when people will do foolish things; we had been
    "slumming," and he was disguised in "pearlies," whilst I was
    gowned "<i>à la</i> 'ARRIETT")&mdash;and I assure you our
    Donkeys went very fast. However&mdash;this is a
    digression&mdash;as the man said when he walked over the cliff,
    so let us "<i>noch einmal zu unser schafen</i>," as the German
    proverb runs. Although disappointed in the behaviour of <i>La
    Flêche</i>, my second string <i>Llanthony</i> maintained my
    reputation for correct tips, by running <i>last</i>, as I said
    he would!&mdash;It is true that some papers report him as
    having finished seventh and <i>El Diablo</i> last; but as he
    did not <i>win</i>, he might just as well have been last as
    seventh&mdash;and as I am sure my friend Lord ELTHAM will not
    mind the placings being reversed&mdash;I therefore place
    <i>Llanthony</i> last&mdash;and those of my readers who took my
    advice and backed him, will have every reason to congratulate
    themselves when they draw their money!</p>

    <p>With regard to the winner, <i>Sir Hugo</i>, whose success
    was a general surprise to all except myself&mdash;(surprise is
    bad form)&mdash;I can only follow the example of all other
    writers on turf matters in declaring that, "he always had my
    good word, and was in fact my winter favourite, as anyone can
    see who will take the trouble to glance through my earlier
    advices!"&mdash;these will be difficult to find, as they were
    only conveyed in private letters which will not be published
    until my biography is written later on!&mdash;(very much, I
    hope). Still, had I pursued the ordinary course of trying to
    tip the <i>Winner</i>, <i>Sir Hugo</i> would undoubtedly have
    been my sole selection&mdash;a fact which should not fail to
    weigh with my followers&mdash;and I <i>have</i> followers in
    plenty, as Lord ARTHUR knows!</p>

    <p>Having done the whole of Epsom week, I shall be glad of a
    rest to get ready for Ascot&mdash;(four new gowns to try
    on)&mdash;and besides there are some smart parties to attend
    next week, so Doncaster will not be blessed with my sweet
    presence. However, I have a friend there on the Press <i>who
    can be trusted</i>. So, in concluding this letter with my
    selection for the last horse in the Manchester Cup, I am able
    to recommend it <i>very</i> strongly, as my friend will do the
    placing; and as <i>I</i> am not there, no collusion can be
    suspected!</p>

    <p>I must just mention that among the shows provided on Epsom
    Downs for the entertainment of the multitude, was one which I
    should like to see done away with, namely, the so-called "glove
    contests"&mdash;which to my mind are not calculated to advance
    "England's greatness" nor are they pleasing to look on at. The
    "abolition of Slavin(g)" is undoubtedly a fine thing, but is
    hardly perhaps an unmixed blessing when it makes heroes of
    Dusky Warriors!</p>

    <p>I hear from my friend Major CLEMENT that we are going to
    have a most successful Ascot in spite of the regrettable
    absence of Royalty; indeed he could have let all the Boxes
    twice over&mdash;and as I shall be staying there all the week
    with my friends the Baron and Baroness LUTHER VON MONTAG, I
    hope to collect some valuable information for my betting
    readers.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours devotedly,<br />

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 30.</i>&mdash;House met
    to-day, with pretty assumption of things being just as usual.
    SPEAKER in Chair; Mace on Table; paper loaded with questions;
    House even moderately full. Mr. G. not present, but SQUIRE OF
    MALWOOD makes up for that, and all other deficiencies. Quite
    radiant in white waistcoat and summer pants; wish he would
    crown the effect by wearing white hat; draws the line at that.
    "People are apt to forget," he says, "that my father was a
    dignitary of the Church. It is well sometimes to hint at the
    circumstance, and it would be impossible to do it from under
    the brim of a white hat." The item scarcely needed to complete
    joviality of Squire's appearance and bearing; looks like the
    best man at a wedding-party. "That's just what I am, TOBY," he
    said; "Mr. G. is going to the country to wed the majority at
    the polls, and I'm the best man."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/286-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/286-2.png"
             alt="Truculent Tim." /></a>Truculent Tim.
    </div>

    <p>Meanwhile, farce of there being nothing particular in the
    wind admirably kept up. Odd to see how even mention of that
    blessed word Dissolution is avoided. Even when, last Thursday,
    Mr. G. and Prince ARTHUR practically settled the matter, the
    word not uttered. Mr. G. hinted at possibility of ARTHUR's
    sometime, in some convenient circumstances, making a statement
    as to the business of the Session; the Prince, adopting the
    phraseology, said he would do so. Since then the same
    precaution been observed.</p>

    <p>"It's not a new idea," Prince ARTHUR said just now, when I
    commented on the peculiarity. "When a man is sick unto death,
    people don't mention in his presence the particular form of
    disease that is carrying him off. Neither do we openly talk of
    Dissolution in a Parliament whose days are numbered."</p>

    <p>SEXTON finally got off his speech on Irish Education Bill,
    though under peculiarly distressing circumstances. Might have
    delivered it before Easter, when Bill was reached one evening
    at eleven o'clock. SEXTON thought the hour inconvenient and the
    audience inadequate for the oration; insisted upon postponing
    it. Must be delivered <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"
       id="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span> to-night or never; so
       worked it off, speaking for an hour in almost empty and
       sadly inattentive House. TIM HEALY, not to lose an
       opportunity that might be final, joined in debate. Audience
       being chiefly composed of JACKSON, TIM took opportunity of
       genially observing, <i>à propos</i> of the Bill, that if he
       had to spend his time on a desert island with either a Chief
       Secretary or an Irish peasant, he would prefer the peasant.
       "I'm glad of that," said JACKSON; "it would be lonely for
       the one that was left. Within a week the population would
       certainly be reduced by one-half. Whether the survivor would
       be TIM or the other one, would depend upon circumstances."
       <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Irish Education Bill read Second
       Time.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;ELCHO's speech to-day, in supporting
    WILFRID LAWSON's Motion against Adjournment over Derby Day,
    most excellent fooling. A dangerous thing to play practical
    jokes with House; only a person of ELCHO's supreme coolness
    would have faced the fearful odds. A desperate man having done
    so, might, by swerving however slightly to left or right, have
    made mistake, and been angrily dropped on by watchful House.
    GRICE-HUTCHINSON had some experience of this in his truncated
    speech. Commenced at length to be funny in usual ante-Derby Day
    fashion; beginning to draw picture of his leading WILFRID
    LAWSON by hand over Epsom Downs. Members opposite snorted
    disapproval; GRICE-HUTCHINSON abruptly shut up; like the
    unfinished window in Aladdin's Tower, his carefully-prepared
    joke unfinished must remain. With this awful warning, ELCHO
    rose unperturbed and unabashed. Was a success from first
    moment; SPEAKER artlessly contributed to it; GEDGE had
    something to say; been popping up whenever opening occurred;
    here again competing with ELCHO; which should be preferred?</p>

    <p>"Does the noble Lord," said SPEAKER, with bland sarcasm,
    "rise to second the Amendment?"</p>

    <p>Now the Amendment was WILFRID LAWSON's, and met with direct
    negative proposal to adjourn over Derby Day. Last time question
    to the fore ELCHO had moved the Adjournment. To suppose he was
    now going to back up WILFRID LAWSON in opposing it was an
    exquisite jape, worthy of the Chair. But ELCHO capped it. "Yes,
    Sir," he gravely answered.</p>

    <p>This was a flash of humour everyone could see. The crowded
    House, wearied with what had gone before, positively jumped at
    it. But it was a kind of joke that had to be lived up to. Could
    ELCHO do it? Would he spoil it by going too far, or would he
    shrink affrighted from the position audaciously assumed? He did
    just the right thing, in tone, manner, and matter, affording
    the House the merriest moments ever enjoyed on a deathbed. It
    seemed so good that it was idle to expect anything better to
    follow. But something there was. It was the Division, in which
    ELCHO, walking up to the Table by side of WILFRID LAWSON, acted
    as co-teller whilst the figures were announced that abolished
    the Derby Day holiday in the House of Commons. ELCHO had had
    his jest, and the Opposition had his estate.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Motion for Derby Day negatived
    by 158 Votes against 144.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Spent quite cheerful Derby Day in
    Commons. House met shortly after twelve; when I say House, I
    mean the SPEAKER and me. "Dearly beloved TOBY," said the
    SPEAKER, "it seems we're to have the place to ourselves." But
    presently HOWELL arrived, and GEDGE, terribly afraid that he
    should miss prayers. "I suppose my opportunities will not be
    extended. Stockport doesn't seem to care to have me in the new
    Parliament, and I'm not aware of any competition for my hand
    among other constituencies. So I mean to make the most of what
    time is left. I fancy they'll at least miss me at St.
    Margaret's. Proudest moment in my life, TOBY, when the other
    Sunday, I overheard one of the Vergers saying to another, 'Man
    and boy I've been in this 'ere church for forty year, but I
    never heard a Amen carry so far as Muster GELGE pitches his.'
    It's something to be appreciated, TOBY. Can't say that House of
    Commons has taken to me kindly; but toward what may be the
    close of a Parliamentary career, the tribute of this honest
    Verger is, I will admit, soothing."</p>

    <p>(12:25.)&mdash;GEDGE moves Count; bells ring; SQUIRE OF
    MALWOOD strolls in with the pleased expression of a man who
    might be at the Derby, but isn't; HORACE DAVY and some others;
    all told only 13. "If you'll excuse me. Gentlemen," said the
    SPEAKER, "I'll retire; look in again little later."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/288-2.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p>(1 P.M.)&mdash;SPEAKER back in Chair; ATTORNEY-GENERAL moves
    Count; bells ring as before; SQUIRE OF MALWOOD again comes in;
    no deception; wasn't lurking about with intent to show up in
    House, then rush off to catch half-past twelve train for Epsom.
    Heads counted; only 19 present; must have forty or no House.
    "Look here, Gentlemen," said the SPEAKER, "this won't do. The
    Chair is not to be trifled with. I shall again retire, and
    won't come back till four o'clock, or till I am assured there
    are forty Members present."</p>

    <p>SPEAKER gathered up skirts and strode forth. Three hours
    before House can be Counted Out. What's to be done in the time?
    ELLIOT LEES determines to make a book; 6 to 4 no House (<i>t.
    and o.</i>); HENRY FOWLER wouldn't bet; but ROBY put something
    on, and ALBERT ROLLIT staked a fiver.</p>

    <p>(4 P.M.)&mdash;SPEAKER back again; House much fuller now;
    ELLIOT LEES looking anxious; made a nice book if he can only
    pull it off. But arrival of half a dozen Members would upset
    everything. ROBY and ALBERT ROLLIT rushing about corridors
    trying to bring men in; LEES KNOWLES moves Count; more ringing
    of bells; ROLLIT and ROBY, on picket-duty to last moment,
    nearly locked out; SPEAKER counts; finds only 35. "The House
    will now adjourn," says the SPEAKER. "Don't see why we should
    have met at all," says ROBY, snappishly. "I do," says ELLIOT
    LEES, making his little collection. "I've had a pleasant and
    profitable afternoon."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;House not made.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;House met at two o'clock; might have
    sat till seven; but at five minutes to five gently broke up.
    Won't be back till Thursday. "Not much of a holiday." said
    Viscount GRIMSTONE, formerly of the Herts Militia; "better make
    the most of it;" and he set off at the rate of five miles an
    hour.</p>

    already there, acts up to his name, as a Member of the Church
    Militant, with pluck and perseverance, whether right or wrong
    it is not for <i>amicus curiæ</i> to say. But, it may be asked,

    nephew, who read the letter aloud, "I am off to see Woodhall
    Spa." "What!" she exclaimed, "Prize-fighting beginning again!
    And isn't Mr. WOODHALL or WOODALL a Member of Parliament? He

    <p>FRENCH PLAYS IN LONDON.&mdash;The old saying applies, "They
    do these things better in France." London prefers to go to
    Paris for its French plays; but when two rivals, a BERNHARDT
    and a COQUELIN, come over to London, Londoners give the lady a

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
